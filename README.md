# poore-58-missed-genomes
This provides a quick way to import the TCGA metadata and data and find 58 genomes that should have been excluded in Kraken-TCGA-Voom-SNM-Most-Stringent-Filtering-Data.csv

You will need to get at least 3 files from 
https://ftp.microbio.me/pub/cancer_microbiome_analysis/TCGA/Kraken/

This is required obviously to see which genomes it included.
Kraken-TCGA-Voom-SNM-Most-Stringent-Filtering-Data.csv

Then you need one of these sets. Both sets produce the same 58 genomes that should have been removed.

Metadata-TCGA-Kraken-17625-Samples.csv
Kraken-TCGA-Raw-Data-17625-Samples.csv

or

Metadata-TCGA-All-18116-Samples.csv
Kraken-TCGA-Raw-Data-All-18116-Samples.csv

I have included the imports you will need for R to run the first part of Poore's normalization code, the part that identifies genomes with no information that need to be removed prior to voom normalization.

Change your working directory from C:\\tcga to where you save the data files.
Please report any errors so I can update this project.
